         In conclusion, the main downsides that were discovered with the interface was that the layout of the buttons is fine
         as it is but could use tweaking to make sure that it works with higher resolutions as well as perhaps changing the size
         of the buttons to aid visiblity. These changes are reasonable and shouldn't require much techincal skill to fix but it
         is important to note that these small changes contribute to the feel of the interface as does general re-organization
         of the controls screen. The general consensus of the results gained by reviewing the controls screen was that the
         background didn't fit the theme from the main menu but having the same re-usable background could potentially make
         the product a lot worse even though it aids in being a cohesive package. By using both methods of evaluation, I have
         found that although there are some results that appear in both ways, having other people test the interface and the
         controls screen provided much better feedback to work from instead of a Heuristic Evaluation. This could be because
         the choice of the heuristics I have decided to review could be more relevant to the product itself as the questions
         are too broad to gain actual feedback from. Furthermore, the surveys could have included more actual multi-choice
         questions instead of providing a text field as this data can then be used to be sorted into graphs and provide
         statistical value to the research.
