         The results state that the layout was fine for the most part but the suggestion of perhaps reducing some of the space
         inbetween the buttons could aid in cohesion as everything will be neatly organized and the user shouldn't have to spend
         a long time looking for buttons to play the game, the faster this process is, the better. Furthermore, the organization
         of the elements on the control screen was brought up as an issue and changing the location of each section could aid
         in the user understanding what to do slightly better as the information is being presented in a cohesive manner. This
         is something that could be changed alongside the way the space is being utilized as the way it is now, there is a lot
         of space in the middle that isn't being used. To fix this, one of the reviewers has suggested testing different layouts
         to see what works best. The main feedback for the logo was fine, two people liked the fact that it was in the middle
         of the screen with one review suggesting a change to the left side instead. I prefer it being in the middle as it is
         the very first thing the user sees as soon as the screen is acccessed but I could see the reasons for the left side too.
         In response to the simplicity side of the controls screen, a lot of the feedback suggested re-facturing the layout
         to something more organized and I agree with this change as each element is currently in the corner instead of
         being presented as a focal point in the middle. Finally, changing the button sizes would aid in the viewer seeing
         the buttons on higher resolutions as this interface was made for a 800x640 screen as well as making it less empty on
         the sides.

          The heurstic evaluation results state that the interface is missing a way to know where the user is at when
          navigating away from the main menu screen but the Controls screen includes this. Having visible text that
          states which screen the user is at on the bottom right or left of the screen can aid the user in navigation
          if the user doesn't know where he/she is. The controls screen is missing a button that takes the user back
          to the main screen and as such, if the user wants to go back, there is no way to do so and the player is
          forced to play. This is a disadvantage because if an options section was to be included, the user should
          always be able to go back and change the settings or be able to not commit to the game straight away and
          stay idle. The main menu interface has a background picture but the controls screen doesn't share the same
          image, to make the entire product more cohesive, the same image could be used on the controls screen or
          something similar to aid familiarity. This interface was made with the mouse in-mind and as such, is missing
          shortcuts. The information that is being displayed on both screens is relevant to where the user has gone.
          Both the main menu and the controls screen are simplistic and don't contain too much information to
          confuse the user.
