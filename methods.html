           Method 1: Survey
           <br>
           <br>
           The first method is a survey to get a second insight and opinion on the UI to get an idea of which elements are disliked and or
           need to be altered. I will be asking questions such as: <br>
           1. What do you think about the layout of the buttons on the interface? <br>
           2. What would you change about the way the controls are displayed? <br>
           3. What do you think about the location of the logo? <br> 
           4. How would you change the layout to make it more simple? <br> 
           5. What would you change about the controls screen? <br>

           Method 2: Heuristic Evaluation
           <br>
           <br>
         The second method is a Heuristic Evaluation and as such, I will be comparing my UI to make sure they fit these standards which were
         inspired by Nielsen's Heuristics. Here are the standards that will be considered in review: <br>
         1. Can the user see what screen he/she is currently at? The user should be able to clearly identify where he/she currently is within the system i.e. if on the main menu, 
           it should say “Main Menu” somewhere on the screen. <br>
         2. Can the user go back to the main menu from any screen within the game?  <br>
         3. Are the visuals of the Main Menu consistent with other parts of the UI? <br>
         4. Can the user use shortcuts to navigate through the menu? <br>
         5. Does the system maintain a simplistic design to help new users get established faster?  <br>
         6. Is the information on the screen relevant to where the user has navigated to?  <br>
         7. Does the main menu layout accommodate simplicity and ease of access? <br>
         8. Does the control screen layout accommodate simplicity and ease of access? <br>
         9. Can the average user determine how to access the game and the controls screen in a short amount of time?  <br>
