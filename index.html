          Introduction of Game:
         <br>
         </br>
        
         Pillars was the first unfinished game that was developed during the first year and it was mainly a RTS game, sharing similarities
         with Endless Legend and Endless Space series. Each pillar would represent a leader figure that is followed by each village and the
         main goal of the game was to complete task for these leaders to gain experience and further power-up your character to one-day match
         the power of these rulers. The difficulties came when trying to program a turn-based system on hexagons. I made a working UI with a
         Controls screen and in this evaluation, I will be identifying some of the issues and things to improve when trying to create an
         interface in the future.
