         To properly conduct a survey research, I have asked 3 of my colleagues to answer the survey and here are some of the
         results. When asked about the layout of the buttons on the interface, the overall response was that the layout was fine
         and okay. However, one of the reviewers has suggested that the buttons could be "meshed together more to reduce some
         of the empty space. In addition, when asked about what could be changed about the way the controls are displayed,
         the general feedback was to make it more organized with one of my colleagues suggesting that the space isn't being
         utilized efficiently as well as a suggestion to try out different layout combinations to see what fits. I have also
         asked what they thought about the location of the logo and two of them have said that it is Good and the other one,
         thought it was Bad. Following on from that question, I asked what could be changed in the layout to make it simpler
         and the response was to re-facture the layout, change the background to something more colourful and to simplify
         the text more. Finally, I asked for their opinion on what they would change about the interface and 2/3 reviewers
         have said that the buttons need to be increased in size as "it would fill some of the side spaces more".

         To conduct this Heuristic Evaluation, I have made my own heuristics based on Niehlsen's guideline and the results
         are as follows. The user should always be able to see where in the interface he/she is at all times, compared to
         my interface however, only the Controls screen has identification via large text that says "Controls" at the top
         of the screen. To increase interactivity, the user should be able to navigate away and to from any point in the
         interface and in my case, the Controls screen doesn't have a back button because it was made with the intention
         of having the user click again to navigate to the game. For consistency purposes, the background should be consistent
         with each part of the interface however, the main interface doesn't share the same background as the controls screen
         as it is replaced with a black background instead. The interface was made to work with mouse clicks only and as such,
         short cuts are non-existent. Both the controls screen and the main menu share a fairly simple design but it lacks in
         being interactive. All of the information that is on each screen is relevant to where the user is currently at. With
         just 3 buttons on the main menu and bits of information on the controls screen, simplicity is maintained throughout.
